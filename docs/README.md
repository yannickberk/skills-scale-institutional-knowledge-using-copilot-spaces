# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to enable consistent, high-quality delivery across cross-functional teams, with an emphasis on transparency, iterative improvement, and stakeholder alignment. At the heart of the methodology is a structured project lifecycle that spans initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective phases. Each phase is supported by well-defined artifacts, such as the Project Charter, backlog, risk register, and release notes, which ensure clear documentation and alignment on goals, milestones, and responsibilities.

Core roles are distinctly outlined to foster accountability and collaboration. Project Managers coordinate delivery schedules, risk management, and communications, while Product Managers own the product vision, prioritize work, and measure outcomes. Developers are responsible for designing, building, and testing software, and QA specialists validate features against acceptance criteria. Stakeholders—including sponsors and dependent teams—are regularly engaged for input and approvals, ensuring that business needs are met and dependencies are managed proactively.

Key workflows revolve around agile-inspired practices such as daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, backlog prioritization, and iterative planning of sprints or milestones. The team utilizes a project board to track work through stages like Backlog, In Progress, QA, and Done, with small, testable increments as the preferred mode of delivery. Quality assurance is embedded throughout the process: code changes undergo unit and integration testing, end-to-end smoke tests are run before releases, and security scanning is automated in CI pipelines. Manual QA is performed as needed for critical features, and at least one approval is required before merging code.

Communication is frequent and multi-layered, with weekly PM and Product syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations for blockers or incidents. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a dedicated register and reviewed regularly, with escalation paths defined for issues that impact delivery. Continuous improvement is encouraged through retrospectives after each sprint or release, where learnings are captured and action items are assigned. This consistent, repeatable approach not only accelerates onboarding but also reduces single-person dependency, ensuring that institutional knowledge is shared and maintained.
