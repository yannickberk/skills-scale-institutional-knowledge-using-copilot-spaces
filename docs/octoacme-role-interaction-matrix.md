## Typical Interaction Frequencies

### Daily
- **Developers ↔ Developers**: Code reviews, pair programming
- **Developers ↔ DevOps Engineers**: Pipeline issues, deployment support
- **Support Specialists ↔ Developers**: Critical bug escalations

### 2-3 Times per Week
- **Developers ↔ UX Designers**: Design implementation collaboration
- **Product Managers ↔ Developers**: Backlog refinement, sprint planning
- **Security Lead ↔ Developers**: Vulnerability remediation

### Weekly
- **Product Manager ↔ Project Manager**: Status sync, roadmap alignment
- **Business Analyst ↔ Product Manager**: Requirements validation
- **Support Specialist ↔ Product Manager**: Customer feedback review
- **All Roles**: Sprint planning, retrospectives, team syncs

### Bi-weekly or Monthly
- **Security Lead ↔ All Roles**: Security training, compliance reviews
- **DevOps Engineer ↔ Business Analyst**: Performance metrics review
- **UX Designer ↔ Support Specialist**: User feedback synthesis

### Ad-hoc / As Needed
- **Security Lead ↔ DevOps Engineer**: Incident response
- **Project Manager ↔ All Roles**: Blocker escalation
- **Business Analyst ↔ UX Designer**: Process improvement workshops

## Communication Best Practices

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- **Use Synchronous (Meetings, Calls)**:
  - Design reviews and critiques
  - Security incident response
  - Blocker escalation and triage
  - Kickoff and retrospective meetings

- **Use Asynchronous (Comments, Docs, Tickets)**:
  - Code reviews and PR feedback
  - Requirements clarification
  - Status updates and progress reports
  - Non-urgent questions and clarifications

### Escalation Paths
1. **Level 1**: Direct role-to-role communication (Slack, comments)
2. **Level 2**: Involve Project Manager for coordination
3. **Level 3**: Escalate to Product Manager or leadership for business decisions

| Interaction Type | Recommended Tools | Participants |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Requirements gathering | Video calls, collaborative docs | Product Manager, Business Analyst, Stakeholders |
| Design reviews | Design tools (Figma, etc.), video calls | UX Designer, Product Manager, Developers |
| Code reviews | GitHub PRs, code comments | Developers, Security Lead |
| Sprint planning | Project board, video calls | All team members |
| Deployment coordination | Slack, deployment logs | DevOps Engineer, Project Manager, Developers |
| Incident response | Incident channel, video calls | On-call team, Security Lead, DevOps Engineer |
| Customer feedback | Support tickets, feedback tools | Support Specialist, Product Manager, UX Designer |
