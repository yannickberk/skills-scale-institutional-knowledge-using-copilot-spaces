# OctoAcme Role Handoff Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure smooth transitions between project phases and roles by documenting what needs to be communicated, delivered, and verified during handoffs. Use this checklist to minimize knowledge gaps and prevent dropped responsibilities.

- [ ] Schedule handoff meeting with receiving role(s)

### During Handoff
- [ ] Walk through key deliverables and artifacts
- [ ] Review open issues and dependencies
- [ ] Answer questions and clarify expectations
- [ ] Confirm acceptance criteria for next phase

### After Handoff
- [ ] Receiving role confirms understanding
- [ ] Document handoff completion in project tracker
- [ ] Remain available for follow-up questions
- [ ] Update project status and role assignments
